The {\ttfamily ccfd} code is a drop-\/in replacement for {\ttfamily cfdfv}, a CFD \href{https://github.com/flexi-framework/cfdfv}{\texttt{ code}} written in Fortran by the \href{https://www.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/en/}{\texttt{ Institute of Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics}} at the University of Stuttgart for a CFD programming course. This program uses \href{https://cgns.github.io/}{\texttt{ CGNS}}, for storing the calculation results.

{\ttfamily ccfd} is a two-\/dimensional finite volume solver for the Euler-\/ or Navier-\/\+Stokes-\/equation systems on structured or unstructured grids. It can perform 1st or 2nd order spacial and temporal discretization, with explicit Euler or Runge-\/\+Kutta integration, or implicit Krylov subspace iteration. The code runs on multiple threads using Open\+MP parallel for loops, if compiled with {\ttfamily -\/fopenmp}. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily git}
\item {\ttfamily gcc}, or any other C compiler
\item {\ttfamily make}
\item {\ttfamily cmake}
\item {\ttfamily gnuplot} (optional, for displaying calculation residuals, available \href{http://www.gnuplot.info/}{\texttt{ here}})
\item {\ttfamily gmsh} (optional, for mesh generation, available \href{http://gmsh.info/}{\texttt{ here}})
\item {\ttfamily paraview} (optional, for post-\/processing the results, available \href{https://www.paraview.org/}{\texttt{ here}})
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The installation process is easiest on Linux, but possible on Mac\+OS and Windows.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Linux}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
First make sure that all necessary dependencies are all installed. These can usually be obtained through your distributions package manager, on Arch based systems the following command should suffice 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# pacman -\/S git base-\/devel cmake}

\end{DoxyCode}
 For an Ubuntu based system the following command should be enough 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# apt-\/get install git build-\/essential cmake libomp-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}


Next, navigate to the directory where you want to keep {\ttfamily ccfd}, clone the git repository and compile the code 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd path/to/directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/hhh95/ccfd.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd ccfd}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make}

\end{DoxyCode}
 There should now be two new folders, {\ttfamily obj} and {\ttfamily bin}, the last one containing the {\ttfamily ccfd} executable.

You can test the compiled binary file, by executing the following command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make check}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will execute {\ttfamily ccfd} in the directory {\ttfamily check} on some small cases that test specific functions of the program.

Continue with \href{\#usage}{\texttt{ Usage}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Mac\+OS}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
I only had access to Mac\+OS High Sierra, so some things might have changed, but the general procedure should still be the same on any Mac\+OS version. First, install a package manager that can install all the necessary software for you. I suggest \href{https://brew.sh/}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}. Head on over to their website and follow the installation instructions. Once you\textquotesingle{}re done, install the necessary software to compile {\ttfamily ccfd} 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ brew update}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ brew upgrade}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ brew install git gcc make cmake libomp}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Due to the fact, that on Mac\+OS {\ttfamily gcc} is linked to {\ttfamily clang} per default, which does not work well with Open\+MP, you will have to make a minor edit to the {\ttfamily Makefile}. Open the file with your favorite editor and find the line that defines the C compiler to be used 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{CC     = gcc}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Replace {\ttfamily gcc} with the version that you have installed, most likely it is {\ttfamily gcc-\/9}. To find out which version you have, do the following 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ls /usr/local/bin/gcc*}

\end{DoxyCode}


Next, navigate to the directory where you want to keep {\ttfamily ccfd}, clone the git repository and compile the code 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd path/to/directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/hhh95/ccfd.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd ccfd}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make}

\end{DoxyCode}
 There should now be two new folders, {\ttfamily obj} and {\ttfamily bin}, the last one containing the {\ttfamily ccfd} executable.

You can test the compiled binary file, by executing the following command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make check}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will execute {\ttfamily ccfd} in the directory {\ttfamily check} on some small cases that test specific functions of the program.

Continue with \href{\#usage}{\texttt{ Usage}}. When installing Para\+View, do not choose the Linux version, but the Mac\+OS version.

When using {\ttfamily ccfd} it is very handy to have the ability to open a terminal in a folder from Finder. This is possible, but has to be activated first. Go to {\itshape System-\/settings}-\/$>${\itshape Keyboard}-\/$>${\itshape Services} and then check the box in front of the option {\itshape New Terminal at Folder}. Now, you can right click a folder in Finder and open a terminal in that folder.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Windows}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
I am still working on installing it on Windows directly, but have not yet managed to do so. For now it only works with a \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10}{\texttt{ Linux Bash shell}}. Get the latest Ubuntu shell and complete the installation process. Next, start the Ubuntu shell and install the necessary utilities (if you have never used Linux before, {\ttfamily \$} in front of a command means the command can be executed as a normal user and {\ttfamily \#} in front of a command means, you need administrative rights; these can be obtained by typing {\ttfamily sudo} in front of the command and entering the password) 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# apt update}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# apt upgrade}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# apt install git build-\/essential cmake libomp-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}


Now change to your desired working directory 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/hhh95/ccfd.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd ccfd}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make}

\end{DoxyCode}
 There should now be two new folders, {\ttfamily obj} and {\ttfamily bin}, the last one containing the {\ttfamily ccfd} executable.

You can test the compiled binary file, by executing the following command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make check}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will execute {\ttfamily ccfd} in the directory {\ttfamily check} on some small cases that test specific functions of the program.

After everything is set up, continue with \href{\#usage}{\texttt{ Usage}}. However, when installing Para\+View, do not install it in the Ubuntu shell, but rather install it normally for \href{https://www.paraview.org/download/}{\texttt{ Windows}}. When you want to access the files created by {\ttfamily ccfd} from Windows, just type the following into the Ubuntu shell 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ explorer.exe .}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will open the directory in the Windows explorer and you can easily access the file with Para\+View.

If, after trying to open Para\+View, you get an error that a \textquotesingle{}VCOMP140.\+DLL\textquotesingle{} library is missing, follow the explainatins of this \href{https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/missing-vcomp140dll/afca0b6b-3ced-4e82-8ce8-8734a440d516}{\texttt{ Forum Post}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
As a first step you should add the {\ttfamily ccfd} executable to your path. You can do so by running 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ source ccfdrc}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Next, navigate to the {\ttfamily calc} folder. Here you will find example case files, contained in folder. First, try the Riemann problems. Navigate to the {\ttfamily riemann} folder with 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd riemann}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Here you will find the SOD test case, as well as different versions of the case. Start a calculation with 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ccfd sod.ini}

\end{DoxyCode}
 and observe the output. There should be four new files. The initial condition of the case and the calculation results at t = 0.\+25 s. They should all be {\ttfamily .csv} files. You can examine them with any spreadsheet program you like. Alternatively you can use Para\+View, a free post-\/processing program, that can visualize 1D, 2D, and 3D data. For Arch-\/based distributions you can install it from the package manager 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# pacman -\/S paraview}

\end{DoxyCode}


On Ubuntu, the Para\+View program in the repositories does not read CGNS files correctly for some reason. You will need to download Para\+View 5.\+8 from the \href{https://www.paraview.org/download/}{\texttt{ Para\+View website}}. Next do the following 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd folder/where/you/downloaded/paraview}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ tar -\/xvf ParaView-\/5.8.0-\/MPI-\/Linux-\/Python3.7-\/64bit.tar.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# mv ParaView-\/5.8.0-\/MPI-\/Linux-\/Python3.7-\/64bit.tar.gz /opt}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ echo "{}export PATH:\$PATH:/opt/ParaView-\/5.8.0-\/MPI-\/Linux-\/Python3.7-\/64bit/bin"{} >> \string~/.bashrc}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Next open Para\+View in the directory where you performed the calculations 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd path/to/ccfd/calc/riemann}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ paraview \&}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Now, click on {\itshape File}-\/$>${\itshape Open} and select both sets of {\ttfamily .csv} files. Because the results are 1D data, you need to change from {\itshape Render View} to {\itshape Line Chart View}. In the top right of the viewing area, click on the {\ttfamily X} button. Now select {\itshape Line Chart View} from the list. You should now see an empty grid with an x-\/, and a y-\/axis. In the {\itshape Pipeline Browser} to the left, click on the eye icons in front of the loaded files. A plot should appear on the axis grid. It will probably show the initial state. In the top bar, click on the play button. Now, the final state should be shown. You will see the analytical, or exact, solution, as well as the numerical solution.

For more information on the theory, maybe have a look at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod_shock_tube}{\texttt{ Wikipedia}}.

The procedure for running the other cases is the same. However, if the solution data is 2D, then you do not need to switch to {\itshape Line Chart View}. The 2D CGNS output files will usually have more than just the solution file. You can load everything at once by selecting the file that has {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Master} in its name. After loading the file, select all {\itshape Cell Arrays} in the {\itshape Pipeline Browser} and click on {\itshape Apply}. Then you can look at the different fields of the solution, by selecting them in the top bar (where it first says {\itshape Solid Color}).

Some files can only be run with the Navier-\/\+Stokes equations. In order the switch between Euler and Navier-\/\+Stokes equations, open the {\ttfamily Makefile} and change the {\ttfamily EQNSYS} parameter.
